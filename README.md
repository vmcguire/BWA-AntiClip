# BWA-AntiClip

Soft brick-wall at 0 dBFS to protect the band splitter. Three modes (Hard/Soft/Tape), 4x oversampled.

**Category C** · **Tier 3** · part of the
[Bandwidth Audio](https://github.com/vmcguire) plugin ecosystem.

## What this is

BWA-AntiClip is a soft brick-wall stage that catches over-0-dBFS signal before it hits the band splitter (which doesn't tolerate clipping). Three modes the user picks: Hard (transparent), Soft (musical), Tape (saturated).

All 4× oversampled. Live 'above-ceiling' readout in dB. Per-band clip indicator in the X-ray view shows WHICH bands are hitting ceiling.

## How this fits with the rest of BWA

BWA-AntiClip ships on **two surfaces** — same DSP, different UI:

1. **Standalone VST3** — drops into any DAW like a FabFilter / iZotope plugin.
   That's what this repo releases.
2. **Embedded cell inside BWA-Mix** — appears as a per-band / per-group cell
   processor inside BWA-Mix's track grid, sharing BWA-Mix's already-running
   band split and contributing to ecosystem-level cross-plugin features.

Both surfaces consume the **same authoritative DSP module**. Fix a bug once,
fixed everywhere.
